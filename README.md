### 1. Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification 

- ##### Code for the paper Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (EMNLP 2014)

  - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize layers with convolving filters that are applied to local features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing. <br>
