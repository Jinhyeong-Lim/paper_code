### 1. Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification 

- Code for the paper __Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification__ (EMNLP 2014)

  - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize layers with convolving filters that are applied to local features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing. <br>

### 2. Sequence to Sequence Model with Attention

- Code for the paper __Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation__ (EMNLP 2015)

  - An attentional mechanism has been used to improve neural machine translation (NMT) by selectively focusing on
parts of the source sentence during translation.
